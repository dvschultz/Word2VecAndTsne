TAG TEXT FOR TRAINING
Jeff Thompson | 2017 | jeffreythompson.org

Splits text into words and their POS for Word2Vec
training, to keep different senses of the same
word separate in vector space.

Writes the word_POS to keep them together 
when gensim tokenizes the text.

	<word>_<POS> ie: pizza_NN

(Then use TrainModel.py to run the training)

REQUIRES
+ pattern

TO DO
+ how to ignore a unicode warning from pattern?
